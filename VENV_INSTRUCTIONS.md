A virtual environment has been created in the root directory.

To activate it, run the following command:

**On Windows:**

```sh
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

**On macOS and Linux:**

```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Once the virtual environment is activated, you can install the dependencies for the backend:

```sh
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
